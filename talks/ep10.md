Greetings dearest people of the internet.

Welcome to Session 10 of Detective Notes for Cluedo in which probably finish of the program.

Last week I managed to get the card counting working.  Today I want to do three things, then I will be happy.

First I want to have the program highlight any cards in knows were used in the murder not just with a bunch of 'X's I want some thing a bit bigger.

There are two possible ways to know for sure a card is the answer, first if no-one has the card, second if we know all the other cards of that category.

Finally I want to add a Piorot mode, where you don't see the table, but when he gets it, he makes the alert.


Do feel free to comment if you think of any other way to get information that I haven't included.

This doesn't seem to be impossible today. So lets get on with it shall we. I'm going to try in the near future to make a video of this program being tried out, So if you want to see that, like and subscribe, and you'll see when it comes out.
