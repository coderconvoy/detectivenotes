Hello good folks of the internet.

Today I am going to carry on and, possibly complete the detective notes challenge.

Here are the things I still want the program to be able to do, these are left over from last week.

1. I want to be able to add checks from time to time to see if we know all of anyone's cards.  Then if we have all of somebody's cards we can mark all the others as false for them.

2. When we know for sure what any card is, I want that to be highlighted.

3. When we know what All cards are, I want to make a Make a Alert.

Lets get going shall we.
