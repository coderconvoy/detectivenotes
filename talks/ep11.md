Greetings People of the World Wide Web

Today we will be continuing our Detective Notes for Cluedo.

Right now the program works, And will tell you all of the players. All I need to do today is add an alert when it has all three. That shouldn't be a problem.

Then I need to add a Toggle to enter Piorot mode where the computer doesn't tell you what he has learned, or know any cards in advance, but if he works it out before you, then you all lose.

Lets have a quick peek at how the app works right now, then get on with it shall we.
