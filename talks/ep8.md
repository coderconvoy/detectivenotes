Hello Everybody

Welcome to Episode 8 of the Detective Notes Project.

Now technically the program works and is useable, but there are a few things I'd like to allow to change.

1. there is the matter of adding and removing cards. There are actualy a ton of Cluedo games out there with slightly different cards.  You may want to be able to change those as a user.

2. I want to be able to add checks from time to time to see if we know all of anyone's cards.  Then if we have all of somebody's cards we can mark all the others as false for them.

3. When we know for sure what any card is, I want that to be highlighted.

4. When we know what All cards are, I want to make a Make a Alert.

That's still quite a bit to do, but I'm sure we ca do it somehow. Let's get on with it, shall we?
